          Contracts&rdquo;) deployed to the Ethereum blockchain and operating

          such as Ethereum blockchain network nodes owned or operated by third
          parties and plugins or applications licensed from third parties by

          custody of or any responsibility with respect to ETH or any other

          contravention or violation of any applicable Law to which you are
          subject, or contract or agreement to which you are a party or by

          weaknesses, attacks and bugs; (b) advances in cryptography cracking

          cryptocurrencies; and (c) blockchain-based tokens and
          cryptocurrencies and the costs of transacting on the blockchain are
          highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to
          adoption, speculation, technology, security risks and network
          congestion.

        <p>
          9.9 Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement
          carefully. It is part of your contract with the Company and affects
          your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING
          ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
        </p>

        <p>
          Applicability of Arbitration Agreement . All claims and disputes
          (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set
          forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product
          or service provided by the Company or any other Futureswap Team
          Member that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court
          shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis
          under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise
          agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.
          This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company and each
          other Futureswap Team Member, and to any of your subsidiaries,
          affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors,
          and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or
          beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms. Notice
          Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution . Before either party
          may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a
          written Notice of Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) describing the
          nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.
          A Notice to the Company should be sent to the contact information
          set forth in Section 9.12. After the Notice is received, you and the
          Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If
          you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within
          thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may
          begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer
          made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after
          the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to
          which either party is entitled.
        </p>

        <p>
          Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the
          American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), an established
          alternative dispute resolution provider (&ldquo;ADR Provider&rdquo;)
          that offers arbitration as set forth in this Section. If AAA is not
          available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
          alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern
          all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
          method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the
          extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer
          Arbitration Rules (&ldquo;Arbitration Rules&rdquo;) governing the
          arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the
          AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a
          single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total
          amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars
          (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based
          arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims
          or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten
          Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a
          hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing
          will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence,
          unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the
          parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the
          arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date,
          time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award
          rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
          jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater
          than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to
          the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater
          of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs
          (including attorney&rsquo;s fees) and disbursements arising out of
          the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs
          of the ADR Provider.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration . If
          non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall
          be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
          submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
          initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any
          personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
          agreed by the parties.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the
          arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
          statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim)
          and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the
          pertinent claim.
        </p>

        <p>
          Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
          will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the
          Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other
          matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator
          shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part
          of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
          monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
          available to an individual under applicable Law, the AAA Rules, and
          the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement
          of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on
          which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages
          awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
          individual basis that a judge in a court of competent jurisdiction
          would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
          you and the Company.
        </p>

        <p>
          Waiver of Jury Trial . THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
          AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A
          JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall
          be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.
          Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient
          and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to
          very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should
          arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a
          suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND
          THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that
          the dispute be resolved by a judge. Waiver of Class or Consolidated
          Actions . ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS
          ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN
          INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
          ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR
          CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding,
          including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and
          compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties
          agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by
          applicable Law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from
          submitting to a court of competent jurisdiction any information
          necessary to enforce these Terms, to enforce an arbitration award,
          or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
        </p>

        <p>
          Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are
          found under applicable Law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court
          of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be
          of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
          Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth
          in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against
          whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect
          any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
          termination of your relationship with the Company.
        </p>

        <p>
          Small Claims Court . Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or
          the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.
        </p>

        <p>
          Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either
          party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal
          court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A
          request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any
          other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Claims Not Subject to Arbitration . Notwithstanding the foregoing,
          claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
          and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s
          patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject
          to this Arbitration Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration
          Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties
          hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts
          located within Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, for such purpose
        </p>

        <p>
          9.10 Electronic Communications. The communications between you and
          the Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send
          us emails, or whether the Company posts notices on the Site or
          communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a)

          provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that
          such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy
          writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.
